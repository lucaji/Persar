# Persar
my first parser algorithm with four correction strategies

## Dependencies and use
Persar relies on a dictionary file (Codici.txt) that can be automatically composed with an by a command line switch.

The code is pure C++ and only the standard libraries are used.

## Version notes

The last revision is signed as 2.2.3b and dates back to 2001-02-21.

I just restored the file from an old floppy and I haven't cleaned the source yet. Comments are still in italian language, but I was already using english naming conventions.

Unfortunately I haven worked a lot on C++ since then and the code style too looks quite immature as seen from today's expertise. Anyway, I was proud of this program and it took me happily busy for some months during that winter.
