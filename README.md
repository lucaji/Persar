# Persar
my first parser algorithm with four correction strategies

## Dependencies and use
Persar relies on a dictionary file (Codici.txt) that can be compiled by itself if run with a command line switch.

The code is pure C++ and only the standard libraries are used.

## Genesis

It was a cold winter day at the end of the 2000 when somebody came to me and asked if I could code a parser in C++. I had no job whatsoever, I could not afford to go to the Uni, I was unemployed, you know, just after the end of the High School. I had the most valuable thing in the world in abundance: time.

This person was about to get a degree in IT, was older than me, wealthier than me, and deeply ignorant on the matter and of course was a snob and poshy person... 

I had not much experience with C++ (sadly still today I haven't written and learned much more in C++), by the way, I took on the assignment, notes, requirements and in a two months time I wrote this program.

Actually it worked pretty well.

## Version notes

The last revision is signed as 2.2.3b and dates back to 2001-02-21.

I just restored the file from an old floppy and I haven't cleaned the source yet. Comments are still in italian language, but I was already using english naming conventions.

The code style is very basic as I could not use advanced constructs as I did not have much knowledge at the time. Maybe it's just a matter of time...

Anyway, I was proud of this program :)
Enjoy
